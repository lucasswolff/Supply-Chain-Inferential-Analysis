# Supply Chain Inferential Analysis

In this project I used a statistical test to compare the profit of two samples from a population of shippiment orders.
Imagine that a logists manager would like to know if the company is getting more profit from shippimento to Latin America or Europe. By doing that, they can take new strategies on the company, maybe trying to make one of these markets more profitable, or focusing only in the most profitable.
So you, as an analyst, gathered some sample data from past orders, in order to analyse that. Since this is a sample data, we can not only compare the means. We need to check if the mean from both reagions is statistically significant. Meaning to check if that is probably a real difference in the population (all orders) or that difference only occured by random chance in this sample.

In summary, the question is: in 2017, for the orders shipped from the US, the mean profit by order in Europe is bigger than in Latim America?
